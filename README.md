## About EdgeView
EdgeView is a modern, feature-rich image viewer designed as a powerful alternative to basic operating system preview tools. It excels in handling professional workflows, offering exceptional support for a wide array of formats, including high-resolution RAW files from DSLR and mirrorless cameras.
